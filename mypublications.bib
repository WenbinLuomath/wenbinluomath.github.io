abstract = { For any line bundle written as a subtraction of two ample line bundles, Siu’s inequality gives a criterion on its bigness. We generalize this inequality to a relative case. The arithmetic meaning behind the inequality leads to its application on algebraic dynamic systems, which is the equidistribution theorem of generic and small net of subvarieties over a function field. }

  abstract = {In this article, we prove the boundedness of minimal slopes of adelic line bundles over function fields of characteristic \$0\$. This can be applied to prove the equidistribution of generic and small points with respect to a big and semipositive adelic line bundle. Our methods can be applied to the finite places of number fields as well. We also show the continuity of \$\\chi \$-volumes over function fields.},

     abstract = {We establish the geometric Bogomolov conjecture for semiabelian varieties over function fields. We show a closed subvariety contains Zariski dense sets of small points, if and only if, after modulo its stabilizer, it is a torsion translate of a constant variety. A new phenomenon is that a special subvariety may not have a Zariski dense set of points of height $0$.}

abstract = {In this article, we generalize the arithmetic degree and its related theory to dynamical systems defined over an arbitrary field \$\\mathbf\{k\}\$ of characteristic \$0\$. We first consider a dynamical system \$(X,f)\$ over a finitely generated field \$K\$ over \$\{\\mathbb\{Q\}\}\$, where we introduce the arithmetic degrees \$\\alpha (f,\\cdot )\$ for \$\\overline\{K\}\$-points by using Moriwaki heights. We study the arithmetic dynamical degree of \$(X,f)\$ and establish the relative degree formula. The relative degree formula gives a proof of the fundamental inequality, that is, the upper arithmetic degree \$\\overline\{\\alpha \}(f,x)\$ is less than or equal to the first dynamical degree \$\\lambda \_\{1\}(f)\$ in this setting. By taking spread-outs, we extend the definition of arithmetic degrees to dynamical systems over the field \$\\mathbf k\$. We demonstrate that our definition is independent of the choice of the spread-out. Moreover, in this setting, we prove certain special cases of the Kawaguchi–Silverman conjecture. A main novelty of this paper is that we give a characterization of arithmetic degrees of “transcendental points” in the case \$\\mathbf\{k\}\$ is a universal domain of characteristic zero, from which we deduce that \$\\alpha (f,x)=\\lambda \_\{1\}(f)\$ for very general \$x\\in X(\\mathbf\{k\})\$ when \$f\$ is an endomorphism.},    issn = {1073-7928},

abstract = {Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Let G be a connected reductive group over k, P⊆G be a parabolic subgroup and λ:P⟶G be a strictly antidominant character. Let C be a projective smooth curve over k with function field K=k(C) and F be a principal G-bundle on C. Then F/P⟶C is a flag bundle and Lλ=F×Pkλ on F/P is a relatively ample line bundle. We compute the height filtration, successive minima, and the Boucksom-Chen concave transform of the height function hLλ:X(K‾)⟶R over the flag variety X=(F/P)K. An interesting application is that the height of X equals to a weighted average of successive minima, and one may view this as a refinement of Zhang's inequality of successive minima. Let f∈N1(F/P) be the numerical class of a vertical fiber. We compute the augmented base loci B+(Lλ−tf) for any t∈R, and it turns out that they are almost the same as the height filtration. As a corollary, we compute the k-th movable cones of flag bundles over curves for all k.}
